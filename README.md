# Description

    A simple and fun arcade game.
    It's a easy game, with two main instructions, tap left or right ! But yet it's not that easy to survive and master.
  You have to rotate the circle to be able to catch several kind of drops on their right color: for score, coins or game buffs. With these kind of drops you can make different kind of combos to gain better and better high scores. If the color mismatches you gain 0 score but if you catch anything in the forbidden sections of the circles you loose one out of three lives. And if the color it's caught in the right place, well play and see !
  There are 2 ways of ending a game: losing all your lives or finishing your time.
  With the coins you can personalize your game, with new circles, drops and even passive buffs.
  You can choose three kind of levels: easy, medium, hard. So you can master the game in your own pace.
  

     Hope you enjoyed it ! If there are any problems with the game please report them at p.e.iusztin.developer@gmail.com !
